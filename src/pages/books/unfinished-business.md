This is the second book in the trilogy.
The tumultuous events occurring in the lives of the family unfold with the emotive story of young love; the sexual violation of a young child; and the dangerous misadventure of a misguided youth. Mary’s ‘Little Flight of Fancy,’ shows no signs of diminishing with the passage of time, and Caitlin’s ability to foresee events becomes more defined – now it would seem, she can foretell of an approaching death.

Miles Sloane now sits on top of a business empire that like the universe seems to be forever expanding. A chance meeting in Boston reveals information about the two men who had been major catalysts in the direction his life had taken.

The murder of Agneta’s father solidifies Sloane’s desire for vengeance. His killer, along with the two major catalysts in his life are now considered by Sloane to be ‘Unfinished business,’ that require a ‘grave’ solution.

Meanwhile, Freddie pursues his own particular vendetta against those he considers to be responsible for his brother’s death.
