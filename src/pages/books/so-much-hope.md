This is the first book in a trilogy. It is a tale of violence murder and rape;
of premonitions coming true; the of abandonment of his wife and children by Sean
because of the death of British Soldier in Belfast, and the life-long yearning
of a daughter to be reunited with her absent parent; hence the over title 'A
little flight of Fancy.'

It relates to the aftermath caused by the desertion of
his family by Sean; his change of name; his remarriage and his ultimate rise to
wealth and power in America; to the brutal rape of Caitlin by Sean's cousin
McNally; her struggle with an unwanted pregnancy, and the many other
tribulations that descend upon a head that refuses to be bowed down by so much
adversity.

Though times are dark, Caitlins indomitable spirit shines through.
Always there is 'So Much Hope.'

This is a story rich in earthy language and
emotion, yet hopefully, related with a degree of sensitivity and humor.
