What motive impels a woman to pay a visit to her ex husband’s sister-in-law, when ten years previously she had walked out on her husband and two young daughters without a word of explanation?

What thoughts pass through the mind of a man, who on entering his sister-in-law’s house on the very day he receives news of his immanent mortality, finds he is confronted by the last person on earth he would want to meet on that day of all days? What would later impel this same man to consider mending fences with an ex wife who had so grievously wronged him?

What makes a detective police inspector, who is intent upon investigating the sudden death of his brother, resort to drugs in order to coerce a young woman he has recently met into having sex with him?

The answers to these questions are dealt with in the enfolding story.
